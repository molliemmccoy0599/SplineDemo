## Overview
We used spline to creat animations using a demo presented by spline as worked on last class. 

## Users 
the users of this are us this cohort and other beginning designers learning how to use this program. 

## Learnings
This past week we created animation in spline this was a bit of a challenging process but also very reqarding and I am very proud of my finsihed product. I enjoyed making this blob like animation that truly showed me how to use the program in what I think is a more comprehensive manner, I want to continue doing more demos like this to grow my skills.
